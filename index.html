        <p>
          I am Product Development and Robotics Engineer. I work as a Product Development Engineer
          in the Automation Industry. I have aso worked on multiple projects involving robotics in my personal time inlcuding robotic arms and autonomous vehicles.
          My work in innovation has led me to design products that are being <strong> patented </strong>. I enjoy sports and coding on my free time and there is nothing
          that makes me feel more alive. I love animals and I am engaged to he most amazing woman to ever exist.
